This project is part of my Human–Computer Interaction coursework in the Master’s programme at the University of Helsinki. Postpartum Support Application is a concept project aimed at helping new mothers cope with postpartum depression through both community support and AI-powered assistance. The project includes a Figma prototype of the mobile application and a written report based on interviews with real mothers about their postpartum experiences.
